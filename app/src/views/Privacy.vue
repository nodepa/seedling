            <p>
              Even the IP address from which you visit the website is classified
              as personal data due to the potential of being linked with other
              data to eventually identify your person.

            <h4>Cookies and tracking technologies</h4>
            <p>
              Cookies are data files that are placed on your device or computer,
              and often include an anonymous unique identifier that can
              potentially be tied to a person's identity.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a href="https://liaizhongzi.com">LiAiZhongzi.com</a>

              do not use any cookies or store any unique identifiers in any of
              the other places this can be done in your browser or on your
              device.
            </p>
            <p>
              A web beacon is typically a 1-pixel transparent image placed on a
              website in such a way that whenever the website is visited, the
              web beacon is requested from a third-party server, thereby
              informing the third-party server that the page has been visited. A
              unique identifier, potentially tied to a person's identity, can be
              attached to a web beacon and shared with the third-party server
              during the request.
            </p>

              We store on your device the number of times you have seen the "get

              times. This information is never transferred anywhere else.

              The access logs provided by
              <a href="https://aws.amazon.com">AWS</a>
              allow us to get an idea about how much the web app is used, and
              whether usage is increasing or declining. We can also use this
              data to manage some types of errors that may occur in the web app.
              We do not in any way use the access log data to identify you.
