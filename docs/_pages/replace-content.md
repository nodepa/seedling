Replace any and all files in the `seedling/content` folder with your own files.
Providing a `LICENSE.md` file is not technically required. The
`update-license-web-statements.js` script can also be discarded (its purpose is
to update the `LICENSE.md` with copyright information when content files have
changed).

The content must follow the [Content Specification](/content/content-spec).
