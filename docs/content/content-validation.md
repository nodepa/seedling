# Content validation

The semantic integrity of the content specification
can be validated by running a validation test on the content.

## Pre-requisites for running the validation test

Set up a development environment as described in [Get started](/get-started/get-started.md)

## Validating the content specification

```sh
# Inside the `seedlingo/` folder:
cd app
npm run verify:content
```
