## What is Seedling?

Seedling is a digital language learning tool for adults.

A teacher or content developer
can define tailored sets of exercises
from Seedling's templates
to provide skill-adjusted assignments
to a native speaker learning to read their native first-language.

[Li Ai Education](https://liaieducation.com) used Seedling
to make [立爱种字](https://种字.com),
to help
[Putonghua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Chinese) speaking adults
learn to read simplified Chinese characters.

To try the Android app, download [version 0.95.0](
  https://github.com/nodepa/seedling/releases/download/v0.95.0/seedling_v0.95.0_7.apk)
or [check the release history](https://github.com/nodepa/seedling/releases)
for a more recent version.
Download to your phone, then install.
You may have to enable the setting "Install from unknown sources"
before your phone will allow the installation.
