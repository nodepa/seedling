## What is Seedling?

Seedling is a digital language learning tool for adults.

A teacher or content developer
can prepare lessons of curated exercises
using Seedling's included exercise templates
to provide tailored exercises
to someone who is learning to read their native first-language.

[Li Ai Education](https://liaieducation.com) used Seedling
to make [立爱种字](https://种字.com),
to help [Standard Chinese (Putonghua)](
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Chinese) speaking adults
learn to read simplified Chinese characters.

To try the Android app, download [version 0.95.0](https://github.com/nodepa/seedling/releases/download/v0.95.0/seedling_v0.95.0_7.apk) or [check for a more recent release](https://github.com/nodepa/seedling/releases).

You may have to enable "Install from unknown sources"
in the settings of your phone to be able to install.
